It also allows you to target specific browsers so that Babel can do less work and you can ship native ES2015+ to user 😎 ! We are also in the process of releasing v7, so please give http://babeljs.io/blog/2017/09/12/planning-for-7.0 a read and help test it out in beta! Thanks so much for using Babel 🙏, please give us a follow on Twitter @babeljs for news on Babel, join slack.babeljs.io for discussion/development and help support the project at opencollective.com/babel","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/babel-preset-latest/-/babel-preset-latest-6.22.0.tgz","_integrity":"sha1-R7gAUxNQo9xpEm6MN1pAZVzR7v8=","_shasum":"47b800531350a3dc69126e8c375a40655cd1eeff","_shrinkwrap":null,"_id":"babel-preset-latest@6.22.0"},"type":"finalized-manifest"}}
